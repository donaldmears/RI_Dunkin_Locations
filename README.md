# RI_Dunkin_Locations
Is there really a Dunkin' on every street corner in Rhode Island?

The purpose of this exercise is to determine the store coverage across the state of RI. This could be useful to understand market penetration, customer accessibility, targeted marketing, competitive analysis, operational efficiencies, and potential store expansion opportunities. This information can also be supplemented with US Census and internal Dunkin' information for greater insights.
